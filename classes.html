                        Intended for beginners and anyone wishing a grounded foundation in the
                        practice of yoga, this 60 minute class of poses and slow movement focuses
                        on asana (proper alignment and posture), pranayama (breath work), and
                        guided meditation to foster your mind and body connection.

                        movement—you will inhale and exhale as you flow energetically through yoga
                        poses.

                <h2>Relax Anytime with Savasana</h2>
                <p>
                    “Prepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your yoga mat with your arms at
                    your side with palms up. Close your eyes and breathe slowly but deeply. Sink
                    into the mat and let your worries slip away. When you are ready, roll on your
                    side and use your arms to push yourself to a sitting position with crossed
                    legs. Place your hands in a prayer position. Be grateful for all that you
                    have in life. Namaste.”
